    Let's play a searching game. You have been given a map 10x10 cell and inn some cell we've hidden your goal.
    You can move to and from any cell in the field.
    On each move you get information about if the move places you closer or farther from your goal you in comparison 
    from previous location.
    Your function compiles data about previous steps one each step as a list of list, where first and second elements are
    your coordinates (row and column) and third is the info on your status alteration -- "colder" is -1, "warmer" is 1 and "same" is 0.
    For measurement of the distance to the goal we use Euclidean distance. At each step you should return the coordinates for new step.
    If your step places you at the goal cell, then you win! You should find the goal within <strong>12</strong> steps.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Information about previous steps. A list of list. Each list contains coordinates and status alteration (warm, cold same).

    <strong>Output: </strong> Coordinates of your new move. A list of two integers.
