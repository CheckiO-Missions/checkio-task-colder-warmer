    Let's play a game of hide and seek. You have been given a map 10x10 cell and in some unknown cell we've hidden your goal.
    You can move to and from any cell in the field.
    On each move you'll get informed if the move places you closer or farther away from your goal, compared to your previous location.
    Your function compiles data about previous steps, each step is a list of list, where first and second elements are
    your coordinates (row and column) and third is the info on how much closer you've gotten (colder or warmer) -- "colder" is -1, "warmer" is 1 and "same" is 0.
    For your measurement of the distance to the goal you should use the Euclidean distance. At each step you need to return the coordinates for your next step.
    If your step places you within the goal cell, then you win! You should find the goal within <strong>12</strong> steps.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Information about previous steps. A list of lists. Each list contains coordinates and status alteration (warm, cold same).

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Coordinates of your new move. A list of two integers.
